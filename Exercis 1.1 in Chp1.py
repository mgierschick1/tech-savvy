# Exercise 1.1 in Chapter 1

# import math
# r = input("please enter a number:")
# # print(type(r))
# #
# r = int(r)
# print('after conversion,', type(r))
#
# r = float(r)
# # converting from integer to float, to decimal to create range
#
# volume = (4/3)*math.pi*math.pow(r, 3)
# print('The volume of a sphere of {} is {.3f}.'.format(r, volume))
# # brackets are based on order of function
#
# # int is a function that converts something to an integer
